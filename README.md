## Team based Round-Robin Tournament matcher

### Description

The code takes two teams of players and matches them up against each-other in a Round-Robin fashion. I recently needed to conduct a Round-Robin tournament between two teams where each player had to match with every other player on the opposing team, but not with his/her teammates.

Fill the teams in two lists in the main function, and the matches will be written to a text file called `games.txt`. Make sure the teams are of equal size.

### Requirements

Only requirement is `numpy`. It can be installed using `pip`:

`pip install numpy`
